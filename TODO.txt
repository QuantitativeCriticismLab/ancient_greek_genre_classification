Use String IO for potential speedup
Cache tokenized files (with decorators?)
Update readme with virtualenv instructions
Predictable feature iteration order
Use set instead of list where applicable
Use pickle to cache feature extraction results - use git hash to determine that the corpus hasn't been changed
Check list accentuations
Check if value in set instead of equal (and instantiate sets before loops?)

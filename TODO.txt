Use String IO for potential speedup https://waymoot.org/home/python_string/
Cache tokenized files (with decorators?)
Predictable feature iteration order
Use set instead of list where applicable
Use pickle to cache feature extraction results - use git hash to determine that the corpus hasn't been changed
Check if value in set instead of equal (and instantiate sets before loops?)
Output coloring
Revise Google Doc
Download CLTK linguistics data during running program if necessary, and quantify which languages are supported by CLTK
Benchmark time improvement from using cache
